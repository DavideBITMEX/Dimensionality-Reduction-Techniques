## [Link to the Report](https://github.com)

## Introduction

This project analyzes labor force statistics from the Eurostat `lfsa_egan` dataset, focusing on employment trends across Europe by *sex*, *age*, *citizenship*, and *geography*.
The goal is to explore how these factors influence employment over time and how they vary across countries.
Key aspects include employment disparities by gender, citizenship, and age, and the impacts of EU enlargements (2000, 2007) and the economic crises of 2010 and 2023.
The project also includes a **geospatial analysis** of employment patterns for 2023 using interactive maps.

## Objectives

1.  **Analyze Employment Trends**: Explore employment patterns over time by sex, age, and citizenship.
2.  **Examine Gender Disparities**: Investigate persistent gender gaps in employment.
3.  **Geo-Spacial Employment Visualization**: Displays the employment % for each country in 2023.
4.  **Explore Citizenship Differences**: Compare employment trends between EU and non-EU nationals.
5.  **Assess Economic Crises Impact**: Analyze the effects of EU enlargements and economic crises on employment.
6.  **Visual Insights**: Use interactive **R** visualizations to display findings.

## Methods

-   **Data Source**: Eurostat `lfsa_egan` dataset, focusing on labor force statistics.
-   **Analysis**: Statistical analysis of employment trends, with a focus on gender, citizenship, and the impact of economic crises.
-   **Visualization**: Interactive maps and plots created using **R** to showcase trends across countries and demographic groups.

## Results

1.  **Fluctuations**: Employment trends fluctuate due to events like EU enlargements and economic crises, impacting foreign nationals.
2.  **Gender Disparities**: Gender gaps persist, though female employment has grown, especially post-2010.
3.  **Geographical Differences**: Major countries like Germany and France dominate total European employment.
4.  **Citizenship Insights**: Non-EU national employment has increased significantly, particularly after 2010.
5.  **Economic Crises**: The 2010 and 2023 crises have notably impacted employment, particularly for non-EU nationals.

## Conclusion

The analysis highlights key employment trends across Europe, showing fluctuations influenced by EU policies and economic crises.
It reveals persistent gender disparities and increasing employment among non-EU nationals, especially post-2010.
The findings emphasize the need to address employment inequalities and adapt to global labor market shifts.
