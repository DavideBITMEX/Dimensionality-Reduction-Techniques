# Introduction 
This project provides an in-depth analysis of labor force statistics sourced from the Eurostat `lfsa_egan` dataset. The dataset includes a wealth of information on labor market participation, broken down by demographic factors such as *sex*, *age*, *citizenship*, and *geographical regions* across European countries. The goal is to explore how these factors influence employment trends over time and how they vary across different countries and regions.
 
In addition to the statistical analysis, the project also includes a **geospatial analysis** of labor market trends for the year **2023**. This analysis uses interactive maps to visualize employment patterns across different European countries and regions.

The analysis focuses on several key aspects, including the evolution of **Employment Trends**, with particular attention to the differences between citizenship groups, age categories, and genders. Additionally, the project explores employment disparities by gender, as well as the relationship between employment levels and both gender and citizenship categories.

Through the use of **R**'s interactive visualizations, the project further compares employment patterns before and after the EU enlargements in 2000 and 2007, as well as the impacts of two significant economic crises in 2010 and 2023. The findings aim to provide valuable insights into the changing landscape of the European labor market, highlighting the factors that contribute to employment dynamics and the ongoing challenges in achieving gender equality in labor force participation.

# Data Import and Exploration

The `lfsa_egan` dataset was obtained from [EUROSTATâ€™s official website](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/explore/all/popul?lang=en&subtheme=labour.employ.lfsa.lfsa_emp&display=list&sort=category&extractionId=lfsa_egan). This dataset belongs to the *Labour Force Survey (LFS)* and contains annual employment data categorized by different demographics and economic dimensions. <br>
- **Dataset**: 496671 observations and 8 variables. <br>
- **Types of variables**: it mainly contains categorical variables and one numerical variable.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The dataset contains 1 continuous and 7 categorical variables. Out of these, two variables present only one category, so there is no need to explore them. Some interactive visualizations are displayed, showing the distribution of *Missing Values* and the following categorical variables: *sex*, *age*, *geo*, *citizen*, and *TIME_PERIOD*. Users can zoom in on the plot to better visualize the values when they are few.

# Trends over time

To gain a deeper understanding of the changes in employment levels across various citizenship groups from 1995 to 2023, the following analysis was conducted. This analysis aims to identify key trends, anomalies and countrie's contribution over the specified time period. 

## Trends by Citizen Group

### Comparison between all European Countries, European Union Member States and non-European Union Member States

The dataset was filtered into two subsets: one grouping all *European Countries* and the other grouping the *European Union Member States* as of 2020 (`EU27_2020`). Both subsets display values for the *Working Age Population* (`Y15-64`) and include aggregated data for both Females and Males.

<div style="background-color:#D6DBF5; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px;">
**Citizen Group TOTAL**: This category represents the sum of `FOR`, `NAT`, `STLS`, and `NRP.` It does not include `EU27_2020_FOR` and `NEU27_2020_FOR`.
</div>

The dotted blue lines represent key events that may have influenced employment trends:

- **2001**: The combination of preparations for Euro adoption, economic growth, labor reforms, and anticipation of EU enlargement contributed to the significant rise in employment levels. This period marked optimism and structural changes that positively impacted employment across various sectors in the EU.
  
- **2004**: EU Enlargement led to a notable increase in employment levels, particularly for native citizens and total employment.

- **2007**: Bulgaria and Romania's accession to the EU continued to drive an upward trend in employment levels.

- **2008**: The Financial Crisis caused a sharp decline in employment trends due to widespread business failures, reduced investments, and economic contraction, resulting in significant job losses across many sectors in the EU.

- **2020**: The COVID-19 Pandemic led to a slight dip in employment, reflecting the economic disruptions during this period.
    
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
plot_employment_trends(data, include_geo = c("AT", "BE", "BG", "HR", "CY", "CZ", "DK", "EE", "FI", "FR", "DE", "EL", "HU", "IE", "IT", "LV", "LT", "LU", "MT", "NL", "PL", "PT", "RO", "SK", "SI", "ES", "SE"), age_filter = "Y15-64", citizen_filter = unique(data$citizen), plot_title = "Employment Trends by Citizenship Group (EU27_2020)")
```

Employment in the European Union Member States experienced an overall steady growth during the sampling period. National employment (`NAT`) appears to be the most positively affected category by EU enlargement, with a notable shift around this event. Additionally, the "No Responses" category (`NRP`) dropped significantly around the same time period.

Employment levels were influenced by both the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. Total employment decreased from 190 million in 2008 to nearly 184 million in 2010, and again from almost 195 million in 2019 to 193 million in 2021.

The following plot shows the employment trend, of the working population, for all countries that are not European Union Member States. These countries are: *Switzerland*, *Iceland*, *Montenegro*, *Norway*, *Serbia*, *Ukraine*, *North Macedonia*, *Bosnia and Herzegovina*, and *Turkey*.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
plot_employment_trends(data, include_geo = c("CH", "IS", "ME", "NO", "RS", "UK", "MK", "BA", "TR"), age_filter = "Y15-64", citizen_filter = unique(data$citizen), plot_title = "Employment Trends by Citizenship Group (non EU27)")
```

The distribution of the data here is not always homogeneous, highlighting possible anomalies within the data collection process. A significant increase in total employment levels is noticeable after 2004, primarily driven by the variable *No Response* (`NRP`), which contributed substantially to this rise. The 2008 financial crisis does not appear to have had a major impact on total employment, while the *COVID-19 Pandemic* caused a substantial decrease in total employment levels, marking the biggest drop since 2005. This decline mainly affected *Nationals* (`NAT`).

## Trend by Country (EU State Members)

To further investigate employment levels, the contribution of each EU Member State was explored with the following stacked plot. The dataset was filtered to remove the citizen categories `TOT`, `EU27_2020`, and `EA20` to avoid double counting. The working age and sex variables remained unchanged.

Germany appears to consistently have the highest employment levels, followed, for most of the sampled years, by *France*, *Italy*, *Spain*, and *Poland*. Until 2001, some countries had missing values, highlighting potential anomalies, likely due to data collection issues. However, after 2001, data became available for every year without any gaps.

## Trends by Age

Until now, employment trends have been analyzed based on the *Working Age* population (`Y15-64`). The `lfsa_egan` dataset contains 35 different age groups. However, the following analysis focuses on three key age groups:

- **Youth (15â€“24)**: Typically at the start of their working life, including transitions from education to employment.
- **Prime Working Age (25â€“54)**: Represents the bulk of the workforce, where most individuals are well-established in their careers.
- **Older Working Age (55â€“64)**: Reflects those approaching retirement, where employment rates and challenges may differ significantly from younger cohorts.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
plot_employment_trends(data, include_geo = c("AT", "BE", "BG", "HR", "CY", "CZ", "DK", "EE", "FI", "FR", "DE", "EL", "HU", "IE", "IT", "LV", "LT", "LU", "MT", "NL", "PL", "PT", "RO", "SK", "SI", "ES", "SE"), age_filter = "Y15-24", citizen_filter = unique(data$citizen), tickInterval = 5000000, plot_title = "Employment Trends for Youths (EU27_2020)")
```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
plot_employment_trends(data, include_geo = c("AT", "BE", "BG", "HR", "CY", "CZ", "DK", "EE", "FI", "FR", "DE", "EL", "HU", "IE", "IT", "LV", "LT", "LU", "MT", "NL", "PL", "PT", "RO", "SK", "SI", "ES", "SE"), age_filter = "Y25-54", citizen_filter = unique(data$citizen), tickInterval = 20000000, plot_title = "Employment Trends for Prime Working Age (EU27_2020)")
```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
plot_employment_trends(data, include_geo = c("AT", "BE", "BG", "HR", "CY", "CZ", "DK", "EE", "FI", "FR", "DE", "EL", "HU", "IE", "IT", "LV", "LT", "LU", "MT", "NL", "PL", "PT", "RO", "SK", "SI", "ES", "SE"), age_filter = "Y55-64", citizen_filter = unique(data$citizen), tickInterval = 10000000, plot_title = "Employment Trends for Older Working Age (EU27_2020)")
```

As of 2023, *Youth* represent **8.3%** of total employment in the EU Member States, while individuals in the *Prime Working Age* represent **71.9%**, and those in the *Older Working Age* account for **19.8%**. The latter group does not appear to have been negatively affected by the two crises, while both the *Youth* and *Prime Working Age* groups showed a decrease in employment after the 2008 Financial Crisis and the *COVID-19 Pandemic*. 

From 2008 to 2010, employment in *Youth* decreased by 13.2% (resulting in *2.4* million fewer employed people), and in the *Prime Working Age* group, it decreased by 3.5% (resulting in 5.3 million fewer employed people). From 2019 to 2020, employment in *Youth* decreased by 5.8% (resulting in approximately 900,000 fewer employed people), and in the *Prime Working Age* group, it decreased by 2.1% (resulting in 3 million fewer employed people).

The effects of the financial crisis seem to have lasted longer, reaching their lowest levels around 2013-2014, compared to those of the pandemic, where employment began to recover after only two years.

# Geo-Spatial Analysis

Another dataset from *EUROSTAT* was used for this analysis: the dataset `lfsi_emp_a`. This dataset contains similar data to the previous one, but with additional information, specifically the percentage of the working population (`PC_POP`). This added variable provides a deeper insight into the composition of the workforce across different countries and years.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data2 <- get_eurostat("lfsi_emp_a")
```

The percentage of the working population (`Y15-64`) for 2023 is displayed in the following plot.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='100%', out.height='1000px'}

# Gender-Based Employment Trends

To explore how employment levels is distributed across Genders, some interactive plots were displayed.

## Employment Levels by Gender 

The following plot shows the employment levels by *Gender* for individuals aged 15-64 (`Y15-64`) across all EU countries, excluding EU-wide aggregates to avoid double counting. No differentiation was made regarding the *Citizen Groups* (`FOR`, `NAT`, `STLS`, and `NRP` were considered together). A dedicated function was built to generate these specific plots.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(highcharter)

plot_employment_levels_by_gender <- function(
  data,
  age_filter = "Y15-64",
  citizen_filter = c("FOR", "NAT", "STLS", "NRP"),
  sex_filter = c("M", "F"),
  geo_filter = c("EU27_2020", "CH", "IS", "ME", "NO", "RS", "UK", "MK", "BA", "TR"),
  chart_title = "Employment Levels by Gender for the Working Age Population (15-64) Over Time",
  chart_subtitle = "All countries (excluding EU-major aggregates)",
  male_color = "#003399",
  female_color = "#FFCC00"
) {
  # Filter and preprocess the data
  filtered_data <- data %>%
    filter(
      age == age_filter,
      citizen %in% citizen_filter,
      sex %in% sex_filter,
      geo %in% geo_filter
    ) %>%
    mutate(
      year = year(TIME_PERIOD),
      employment_real = values * 1000  # Convert employment values to actual numbers
    )
  
  # Summarize employment by year and sex
  summarized_data <- filtered_data %>%
    group_by(year, sex) %>%
    summarise(total_employment = sum(employment_real, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    ungroup()
  
  # Create the Highcharter bar plot
  hchart <- highchart() %>%
    hc_chart(type = "column") %>%
    hc_title(text = chart_title) %>%
    hc_subtitle(text = chart_subtitle) %>%
    hc_xAxis(
      categories = unique(summarized_data$year),
      title = list(text = "Year"),
      labels = list(rotation = 45)  # Rotate x-axis labels for readability
    ) %>%
    hc_yAxis(
      title = list(text = "Total Employment"),
      labels = list(format = "{value:,}")  # Format y-axis with commas
    ) %>%
    hc_plotOptions(column = list(grouping = TRUE)) %>%
    hc_tooltip(shared = TRUE, pointFormat = "<b>{series.name}</b>: {point.y:,.0f}<br>") %>%
    hc_add_series(
      data = summarized_data %>% filter(sex == "M") %>% pull(total_employment),
      name = "Male",
      color = male_color
    ) %>%
    hc_add_series(
      data = summarized_data %>% filter(sex == "F") %>% pull(total_employment),
      name = "Female",
      color = female_color
    ) %>%
    hc_legend(enabled = TRUE) %>%
    hc_exporting(enabled = TRUE)
  
  return(hchart)
}
plot_employment_levels_by_gender(data)
```

Considering the absolute values, the number of employed *males* was always higher than the number of employed *females* during the considered time frame. The *COVID-19 Pandemic* seems to have had a greater impact on employment levels compared to the 2008 *Financial Crisis*.

The same plot type is displayed twice again: the first considers only EU Member States, and the second considers non-EU Member States, in both cases keeping all other variables unchanged.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
plot_employment_levels_by_gender(
  data,
  age_filter = "Y15-64",
  citizen_filter = c("FOR", "NAT", "STLS", "NRP"),
  sex_filter = c("M", "F"),
  geo_filter = c("AT", "BE", "BG", "HR", "CY", "CZ", "DK", "EE", "FI", "FR", "DE", "EL", "HU", "IE", "IT", "LV", "LT", "LU", "MT", "NL", "PL", "PT", "RO", "SK", "SI", "ES", "SE"
),
  chart_title = "Employment Levels by Gender for the Working Age Population (15-64) Over Time",
  chart_subtitle = "All EU Member States",
  male_color = "#003399",
  female_color = "#FFCC00"
)
```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
plot_employment_levels_by_gender(
  data,
  age_filter = "Y15-64",
  citizen_filter = c("FOR", "NAT", "STLS", "NRP"),
  sex_filter = c("M", "F"),
  geo_filter = c("CH", "IS", "ME", "NO", "RS", "UK", "MK", "BA", "TR"),
  chart_title = "Employment Levels by Gender for the Working Age Population (15-64) Over Time",
  chart_subtitle = "non-EU Member States",
  male_color = "#003399",
  female_color = "#FFCC00"
)
```

*Female* employment levels consistently appear lower than *male* values, both within EU Member States and non-EU Member States. As of 2023, in relative terms, the disparity between employed *males* and *females* is larger in the non-EU Member States. EU enlargement policies seem to have significantly increased employment levels. However, for non-EU Member States this increase primarily affected *males*. The 2008 *Financial Crisis* appears to have had a more significant negative impact on EU Member States, while the *COVID-19 Pandemic* seems to have affected non-EU Member States more.

## Employment Levels by Gender and Country (Working Age: 15-64)

The following interactive visualization allows users to select different years to
observe how employment levels have changed over time across countries
(including the aggregates `EA20` and `EU27_2020`) for the working
population (15-64), providing insights into gender-specific employment
trends and patterns.

# Employment's comparison by Country and Citizienship Category

A comparative analysis was conducted to explore how employment levels vary between different countries for specific citizenship categories. 

For this analysis, a subset was created from the initial dataset, including only the *Working Population* (`Y15-64`) with no differentiation by *gender* (`T`). Specific years were selected for analysis:

- **2000**: Represents the early 2000s, before major EU enlargements.
- **2007**: Captures the effects after major EU enlargements.
- **2010**: Captures employment trends post-2008 *Financial Crisis*.
- **2023**: Reflects the latest available data, including post-*COVID-19* recovery.

Heatmaps were generated for each of these years, and two comparisons were made.

## Heatmaps Comparison - Before and After the EU Enlargements (2000 and 2007)

Heatmaps for 2000 and 2007 were generated and compared to capture the differences in employment levels across countries *before* and *after* the **EU enlargements**. All EU countries have been inserted and EU-major aggregates (`EU27_2020` and `EA20`) have been excluded. Aggregates for Citizen groups were removed to avoid double counting.

The heatmaps for the years **2000** and **2007** show notable variations
in employment levels across different **EU countries** and **citizenship
categories**. The color intensity represents employment levels, with
**darker blue** indicating higher employment.

### Year: 2000 (Before EU Enlargements)

-   Many countries present **Missing Values** for one or more citizen groups, indicating possible issues with the way data were collected during that year.
-   **Employment for nationals** (`NAT`) dominates in most countries,
    reflecting a labor market primarily consisting of native citizens.
-   The employment distribution is more concentrated in **Western
    European countries** like **Germany** (`DE`), **France** (`FR`), and
    the **UK**.

### Year: 2007 (After EU Enlargements)

-   **Noticeable increase in employment for foreign-born category**, reflecting the impact of the
    **2004 EU enlargement** (when 10 new countries joined the EU) and
    anticipation of the **2007 enlargement** (including Bulgaria and
    Romania).
-   Employment growth in countries like **Germany** (`DE`), the **UK**,
    and **Spain** (`ES`) suggests increased **labor migration** and
    **workforce integration** of foreign-born citizens.
-   Some **Eastern European countries** begin to show increased
    employment for nationals and foreign-born category, indicating the
    effect of **free movement of workers** within the EU.
-   Missing values are less dominant compared to 2000.

## Heatmaps Comparison - After 2 Important Crisis (2010 and 2023)

Heatmaps for 2010 and 2023 were compared to capture the differences in employment levels across countries after two important crises: the **2008 Financial Crisis** and the **COVID-19 Pandemic**.

The heatmaps for the years **2010** and **2023** show variations in
employment levels across different **EU countries** and **citizenship
categories**. The color intensity represents employment levels, with
**darker blue** indicating higher employment.

### Year: 2010 (After 2008 Financial Crisis)

-   **Employment for nationals** (`NAT`) remains prominent, but declines (compared to the previous year)
    are observed in some countries due to the impact of the **2008
    financial crisis**.
-   **Lower employment levels for foreign-born category**, reflecting the economic
    downturn's disproportionate impact on migrant workers.
-   Employment growth is still concentrated in countries like
    **Germany** (`DE`), **United Kingdom** (`UK`) and **France** (`FR`), which were more resilient
    to the crisis.
-   **Southern European countries** such as **Spain** (`ES`) and
    **Italy** (`IT`) show noticeable declines (compared to the previous year), consistent with the
    severe economic challenges they faced during this period.

### Year: 2023 (After COVID-19 Pandemic)

-   **Recovery in employment levels** for both nationals (`NAT`) and
    foreign-born category (`FOR`), indicating the labor market rebound after the **COVID-19 pandemic**.
-   Significant employment growth for foreign-born category in
    countries like **Germany** (`DE`), **France** (`FR`), and **Spain**
    (`ES`), suggesting a return to pre-pandemic trends and increased
    workforce integration.
-   **Eastern European countries** show varying employment levels,
    reflecting ongoing economic adjustments and workforce mobility
    within the EU.
-   New **Missing Values** appear for **United Kingdom** (`UK`) and for **North Macedonia** (`MK`), due to UK's decision to leave European Union on 2020 and because North Macedonia implemented Regulation which introduced significant changes to the Labor Force Survey (LFS).

# Conclusions

This analysis of labor force data from Eurostat highlights key trends in employment across Europe, focusing on *sex*, *age*, *geopolitical entity*  and *citizenship.* Employment trends show fluctuations driven by events like EU enlargements and economic crises, particularly impacting foreign nationals. Gender disparities persist, though employment levels for both males and females have grown over time.

Geographical differences are evident, with countries like Germany and France contributing significantly to total employment. The analysis of citizenship groups reveals a notable increase in employment among non-EU nationals, especially post-2010. Overall, the findings underscore the importance of addressing employment inequalities and adapting to global shifts in the labor market.
