# Introduction

This report presents a **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** of
employment data from Eurostat. The goal is to:

1.  **Identify patterns and relationships** between countries based on
    employment statistics for different citizen categories.
2.  **Reduce dimensionality** for easier visualization and
    interpretation.
3.  **Determine the contributions** of each variable (citizen category)
    to the principal components.
4.  **Visualize countries' similarities and differences** in employment
    patterns.

# Data Import and Exploration

The `lfsa_egan` dataset was obtained from [EUROSTATâ€™s official website](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/explore/all/popul?lang=en&subtheme=labour.employ.lfsa.lfsa_emp&display=list&sort=category&extractionId=lfsa_egan). This dataset belongs to the *Labour Force Survey (LFS)* and contains annual employment data categorized by different demographics and economic dimensions. <br>
- **Dataset**: 496671 observations and 8 variables. <br>
- **Types of variables**: it mainly contains categorical variables and one numerical variable.

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, class.source = 'fold-show'}
data <- get_eurostat("lfsa_egan")
```

In order to have a better understanding of the dataset, a brief description for each variable and the corresponding unique values are provided.

# Trends over time

To better understand how employment levels for different citizenship
groups have changed over time (1995-2023) the following analysis was
conducted, helping to identify noticeable trends or anomalies during the
time period. The dataset was filtered, leading to a subset containing
all observations for the **Working Age Population** (`Y15-64`) and
including undifferentiated data for Females and Males.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
# Filter data for working-age population (15-64) and 'Total' for sex
working_age_data <- data %>%
  filter(age == "Y15-64", sex == "T") %>%

    year = year(TIME_PERIOD),
    employment_real = values * 1000  # Convert employment values to actual numbers
  )

# Group employment by year and citizenship

The dotted-blue lines represent relevant events that might have
influenced the employment trend:

-   **2001**: The combination of Euro adoption preparations, economic
    growth, labour reforms, and anticipation of EU enlargement
    contributed to the significant rise in employment levels recorded
    in 2001. This was a period of optimism and structural change that
    positively impacted employment across various sectors in the EU.
-   **2004**: EU Enlargement saw a significant rise in employment
    levels, particularly for native citizens and total employment.
-   **2007**: Bulgaria & Romania Join the EU led to a continued increase
    in employment levels.
-   **2008**: Financial Crisis led to a sharp decline in employment
    trends due to widespread business failures, reduced investments, and
    economic contraction, resulting in significant job losses across
    many sectors in the EU
-   **2020**: COVID-19 Pandemic caused a slight dip in employment,
    reflecting the economic disruption during this period.

### Overall Employment Growth:

Total Employment (`TOTAL`) shows a sharp increase between 2001 and 2007,
stabilizing afterward. This increase coincides with the events following
the Euro adoption preparations (1999-2002), the 2004 EU Enlargement and
2007 accession of Bulgaria and Romania.

### Native Employment:

Employment of Native Citizens (`NAT`) follows a similar pattern to the
total employment trend, meaning that they represent the majority of the
employment. The growth stabilizes post-2007 and experiences a slight dip
during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

### EU citizens working in other EU countries:

Employment of EU citizens working in other EU countries
(`EU27_2020_FOR`) shows a relatively stable trend with moderate growth
over the period.

### Non-EU foreign citizens:

Employment of non-EU foreign citizens (`FOR`) exhibits a gradual but
consistent increase, indicating the growing role of foreign labor in the
EU economy.

### No Response:

No Response (`NRP`) category shows a drop after 2003, possibly showing
the positive consequences of the 2004 EU Enlargement.

# Gender-Based Employment Trends

Two interactive plots were displayed to present employment levels by
Gender over Time and across Countries.

## Employment Levels by Gender for the Working Age Population (15-64) Over Time

The following plot indicates the employment levels by Gender aged 15-64
across all countries, excluding EU-wide aggregates (EU27_2020 and EA20).
The data spans multiple years and provides insights into employment
trends by gender.

## Employment Levels by Gender and Country (Working Age: 15-64)

The following interactive plot allows users to select different years to
observe how employment levels have changed over time across countries
(including the aggregates `EA20` and `EU27_2020`) for the working

# Employment's comparison by Country and Citizienship Category

A comparative analysis eas conducted to explore how employment levels
vary between different countries for specific citizenship categories.
`EU27_2020` and `EA20` have been excluded because they would make the
individual countries less comparable between eachother.

For this analysis a subset was created from the initial dataset,
including just the Working Population (`Y15-64`) and making no
differentiation for genre (`T`). Some specific years were selected: -
**2000**: Represents the early 2000s before major EU enlargements. -
**2007**: Captures the effects after major EU enlargements. - **2010**:
Captures employment trends post-2008 financial crisis. - **2023**:
Reflects the latest available data, including post-COVID-19 recovery.

Heatmaps were generated for each of these years and two comparisons were
made.

## Heatmaps Comparison - before and after the EU enlargements (2000 and 2007)

Heatmaps for 2000 and 2007 were generated and compared to capture the
differences in employment levels across countries **before** and
**after** the **EU enlargements**.

The heatmaps for the years **2000** and **2007** show notable variations
in employment levels across different **EU countries** and **citizenship
categories**. The color intensity represents employment levels, with
**darker blue** indicating higher employment.

### Year: 2000 (Before EU Enlargements)

-   **Employment for nationals** (`NAT`) dominates in most countries,
    reflecting a labor market primarily consisting of native citizens.
-   **Lower employment levels for foreign-born categories**
    (`EU27_2020_FOR` and `NEU27_2020_FOR`) are observed, as the European
    Union had not yet expanded to include countries from Eastern Europe
    (the 2004 and 2007 enlargements).
-   The employment distribution is more concentrated in **Western
    European countries** like **Germany** (`DE`), **France** (`FR`), and
    the **UK**.

### Year: 2007 (After EU Enlargements)

-   **Noticeable increase in employment for foreign-born categories**
    (`EU27_2020_FOR` and `NEU27_2020_FOR`), reflecting the impact of the
    **2004 EU enlargement** (when 10 new countries joined the EU) and
    anticipation of the **2007 enlargement** (including Bulgaria and
    Romania).
-   Employment growth in countries like **Germany** (`DE`), the **UK**,
    and **Spain** (`ES`) suggests increased **labor migration** and
    **workforce integration** of foreign-born citizens.
-   Some **Eastern European countries** begin to show increased
    employment for nationals and foreign-born categories, indicating the
    effect of **free movement of workers** within the EU.

### Key Insights

-   **Impact of EU Enlargement**:\
    The period between **2000 and 2007** shows the effects of **EU
    enlargement**, with a rise in employment for foreign-born categories
    due to increased migration and labor mobility within the EU.

-   **Country-Specific Patterns**:

    -   **Germany** (`DE`) and **France** (`FR`) maintain high
        employment levels across both years, reflecting their strong
        economies and capacity to integrate foreign workers.\
    -   **Spain** (`ES`) shows increased employment for foreign-born
        categories, consistent with the **construction boom** and
        economic growth before the **2008 financial crisis**.

-   **Labor Market Integration**:\
    The increase in employment for foreign-born categories highlights
    the **integration of migrants** into the workforce and the
    importance of policies supporting labor mobility and inclusion.

The heatmaps for the years **2010** and **2023** show variations in
employment levels across different **EU countries** and **citizenship
categories**. The color intensity represents employment levels, with
**darker blue** indicating higher employment.

### Year: 2010 (After 2008 Financial Crisis)

-   **Employment for nationals** (`NAT`) remains prominent, but declines
    are observed in some countries due to the impact of the **2008
    financial crisis**.
-   **Lower employment levels for foreign-born categories**
    (`EU27_2020_FOR` and `NEU27_2020_FOR`), reflecting the economic
    downturn's disproportionate impact on migrant workers.
-   Employment growth is still concentrated in countries like
    **Germany** (`DE`) and **France** (`FR`), which were more resilient
    to the crisis.
-   **Southern European countries** such as **Spain** (`ES`) and
    **Italy** (`IT`) show noticeable declines, consistent with the
    severe economic challenges they faced during this period.

### Year: 2023 (After COVID-19 Pandemic)

-   **Recovery in employment levels** for both nationals (`NAT`) and
    foreign-born categories (`EU27_2020_FOR` and `NEU27_2020_FOR`),
    indicating the labor market rebound after the **COVID-19 pandemic**.
-   Significant employment growth for foreign-born categories in
    countries like **Germany** (`DE`), **France** (`FR`), and **Spain**
    (`ES`), suggesting a return to pre-pandemic trends and increased
    workforce integration.
-   **Eastern European countries** show varying employment levels,
    reflecting ongoing economic adjustments and workforce mobility
    within the EU.
-   **Missing Values** appear for some Eastern countries (e.g.Ukraine
    `UK`, Turkey `TR`, North Macedonia `MK`), probably due to the
    ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

### Key Insights

-   **Impact of Economic Shocks**:\
    The period between **2010 and 2023** highlights the effects of two
    major economic shocks:
    -   The **2008 financial crisis** led to reduced employment,
        particularly for foreign-born categories.
    -   The **COVID-19 pandemic** caused temporary disruptions but was
        followed by a recovery in 2023.
-   **Country-Specific Patterns**:
    -   **Germany** (`DE`) and **France** (`FR`) continue to show high
        employment levels, demonstrating economic resilience and
        effective labor policies.
    -   **Spain** (`ES`) shows employment fluctuations, with a decline
        post-2008 and recovery post-pandemic.
-   **Labor Market Integration**:\
    The rebound in employment for foreign-born categories in **2023**
    underscores the importance of **migration policies** and **workforce
    integration programs** in sustaining labor markets.
